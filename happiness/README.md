### Data Analysis Report

#### 1. Description of the Data
The dataset contains socio-economic and subjective well-being indicators across various countries over a time period ranging from 2005 to 2023. It comprises ten columns:

- **Country name**: The name of the country.
- **year**: The year the data was recorded.
- **Life Ladder**: A subjective measurement of well-being on a scale from 0 to 10.
- **Log GDP per capita**: The natural logarithm of the gross domestic product per capita, reflecting economic performance.
- **Social support**: Self-reported social support on a scale of 0 to 1, representing perceived support from family and friends.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: An estimate of the average number of years a person can expect to live in "full health."
- **Freedom to make life choices**: A measure of the freedom individuals feel they have in making life choices, also scaled from 0 to 1.
- **Generosity**: A measure that captures charitable behavior and altruism on a scale.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: A measure reflecting individuals' perceptions of corruption in their country on a scale from 0 to 1.
- **Positive affect**: Positive feelings experienced by individuals, rated from 0 to 1.
- **Negative affect**: Negative feelings experienced by individuals, also rated from 0 to 1.

Key observations from the dataset summary include the presence of missing values in several critical columns, notably in **Log GDP per capita**, **Social support**, and **Generosity**, which may impact analysis. The dataset encompasses 2363 records across 165 unique countries.

#### 2. Analysis Conducted
The analysis involved a combination of descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization techniques to investigate relationships among the variables. Key steps included:

- **Basic Statistical Summary**: Calculation of mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for each numeric variable.
- **Missing Values Analysis**: Identification and visualization of missing values.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Generation of a correlation matrix to quantify the relationships between numerical attributes.
- **Data Distribution Visualization**: Creation of distribution plots to identify the spread and characteristics of each variable.

The correlations between the *Life Ladder* and other variables were particularly scrutinized, as this metric serves as an overall indicator of subjective well-being.

#### 3. Insights Discovered
- **Correlation of Factors**: The correlation analysis highlighted significant relationships, with *Log GDP per capita* and *Social support* showing a robust positive correlation with the *Life Ladder* (correlation coefficients around 0.6-0.7). This suggests that higher income and stronger social connections are associated with better subjective well-being.
- **Negative Affect and Life Ladder**: There is a moderate negative correlation between *Negative affect* and the *Life Ladder* (approximately -0.5), indicating that higher levels of negative feelings correlate with lower well-being.
- **Distribution Characteristics**: Both *Generosity* and *Healthy life expectancy at birth* displayed skewed distributions, indicating that some countries report significantly higher or lower values, which may warrant further investigation into outliers.

#### 4. Implications of Findings
The insights gained from this analysis have several practical implications:

- **Policy Recommendations**: To improve subjective well-being, policymakers should focus on enhancing social support systems and economic growth strategies that elevate GDP per capita. This could involve investing in community programs that bolster social ties, alongside economic initiatives that create job opportunities.
- **Addressing Negative Factors**: The correlation between negative affect and life satisfaction highlights the necessity for mental health interventions and policies aimed at reducing stressors that negatively impact populations.
- **Targeted Research**: The skewed distributions of some variables, particularly *Generosity* and *Healthy life expectancy*, suggest a need for targeted research to understand the factors contributing to these disparities across countries.
- **Ongoing Data Collection**: Given the substantial amount of missing data in the dataset, it is crucial for organizations to improve data collection measures to ensure that future analyses yield more accurate insights. 

This comprehensive understanding of the interactions between economic factors, social frameworks, and subjective well-being can guide future interventions aimed at enhancing quality of life across diverse populations.
